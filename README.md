# WOLETU
An application that allows students to notify facilities of an area on campus that needs to be repaired through a text description and picture. This application will streamline the process of sending in work orders from the student to facilities via e-mail.

## Objective
* The goal of WOLetu is to be a web application as well as a cross-platform mobile application that simplifies and enhances the work order system facilities currently uses as well as increase communication between the students and workers.  
* WOLetu will be able to store and retrieve user information and user work order history, and automate e-mails from data fields.
* RAs can either edit the e-mail or send to an RD, and the RD can also edit or send to facilities.
* Facilties will be able to provide simple feedback of the status of the work order

## Built Using
* Python 2.7
* MySQL 
* LETU Lab Server
